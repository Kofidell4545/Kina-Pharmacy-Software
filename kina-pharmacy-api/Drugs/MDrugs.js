Artemether is a fast-acting antimalarial that works by rapidly reducing the number of malaria parasites in the bloodstream, while lumefantrine has a longer-lasting effect that helps clear any remaining parasites. This combination makes Lufart effective in treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. It is available in tablet form and is typically taken over a three-day course.",
